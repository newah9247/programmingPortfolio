                <p>My name is Noah Taylor, I am 18 and attend NSCC in Lawrencetown, NS. Specifically the Center of Geographical Sciences, hence NSCC COGS. I am currently
                    enrolled in the IT Programming course, it is a two year course and I am enjoying what we have been doing in it so far.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last year, I graduated from <b>West Kings District High School in Auburn, NS.</b> I passed with honours and I took a Computer Programming course for a semester
                    where I learned a little bit of Java. I had a wonderful teacher and he had taught me a lot about what post-secondary is like. I have him to thank for leading me in the
                    right direction when it came to choosing a school and deciding what I wanted to do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other than school, I have a few hobbies. I enjoy playing video games, currently I have been playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2022). But mainly focusing on my school
                    work as it is the end of the semester and I have to get good grades. I also enjoy taking apart computers, including laptops, and replacing components to see if there is anything
                    that I can upgrade, fix or change.

        <h1>My Skills</h1>
            <section>
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        My skills in each of these sections vary quite drastically compared to some. I feel like I know quite a bit about HTML. If not most things, but I believe that
                        there is always room to improve and learn new things, especially since they are still developing computer languages and creating new ones. There is never a time
                        that you will know everything within IT or programming.
