            <h1>My Learning Narrative!</h1>
            <br />
            <p><b>To describe what my learning narrative is</b> a hard thing to do.
            There is a lot that I want to learn while I am not only in school but afterwards as well.
            I know that we are only at the tip of the iceberg with programming, but I already feel like I have learned a lot especially
            when it comes to HTML. I feel quite advanced in HTML and feel capable enough to make a <b>very</b> good website with enough time and practice.</p>

            <p>Some things that I am looking forward to learning are the C languages, trying to differentiate the syntaxes and whatnot will be a difficult task for me but
                I enjoy learning about things that I am interested in and I feel very inclined to learn everything that I can in college and take my time with learning.
            </p>

            <p>I have very much enjoyed my first semester at COGS, and am excited to see what future semesters/years bring.</p>
